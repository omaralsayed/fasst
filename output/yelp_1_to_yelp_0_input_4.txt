it 's small yet they make you feel right at home .
i will be going back and enjoying this great place !
the drinks were affordable and a good pour .
my husband got a ruben sandwich , he loved it .
i signed up for their email and got a coupon .
i 'd definitely recommend giving them a try .
i highly recommend e & m painting .
otherwise a great experience and we will go again .
good drinks , and good company .
