ever since joes has changed hands it 's just gotten worse and worse .
there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .
so basically tasted watered down .
she said she 'd be back and disappeared for a few minutes .
i ca n't believe how inconsiderate this pharmacy is .
just left and took it off the bill .
it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .
definitely disappointed that i could not use my birthday gift !
new owner , i heard - but i do n't know the details .
but it probably sucks too !
