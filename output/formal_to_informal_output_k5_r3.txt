people will either like u, love, u hate u, or dont care either way!
he feels like he is losing control.
no he doesnt say it only after i do.
he likes u but afraid to start relationhsip.
because our parents gave us names n other parents did the same so that is our parent's fault
best friends are forever

sometimes things bother me that doesn't bother him.
NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!
Black men like big butts and breasts even if the woman is fat.
love poems are nice but telling straight to her is more manly.
you are only going to ruin the friendship and then what.
if he loves u dont worry bout it.
some times like when it comes to looks.
if they dont invite you invite yourself.
if you cannot do this together you have no business getting married.
i guess
you deserve someone who loves u.
first off dude, you should get to know her first.
if you wont ask him why then your wasting your time.
