yeah dude i have hobbies like working out
they get mad if they gain a pound!
he dropped in on me front porch
why not ask him out??
men aren't really men if they beat up on women.
I find him attractive but not my type.
tell your mom!!!
people will either like u, love u, hate u, or dont care either way.
he feels like he doesnt deserve counseling.
sometimes guys say things they dont mean.
he likes u but afraid to start relationhsip.
I wouldn't marry a woman who wouldn't take my name.
friends are forever
if it was truely love then he wouldnt have cheated.
you need counseling.
Secondly - you're not ugly - you're attractive.  You're just overweight.  You're not fat - you're overweight.  You're not ugly

you need counseling.
even told her I would marry her to show her how much I love her.
most young guys i know like dating older women.

Input:  I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO!! PLEASE HELP ME I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO!!
walk the line is awesome.

personality depends on personality.
names
stay together for the child but file for child support.
I prefer bald men too.
wait a while so your mixed feelings subside but if they don't maybe you should just stay friends.
ask him how its going.
you need to pack away your extra baggage and concentrate on him and not your ex.
I asked her where can I get married outside USA easily & fast
okayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
I DONT LIKE ANY BIGGER THAN A 36 C OR D AT THE BIGEST.
because they dont want to admit they are wrong.

hi i'm ok i guess
yeah thats true.
don't compare it to anyone else's life.
DO NOT GO OUT WITH YOUR OLD BOYFRIEND.
Input:  make sure your friend wouldn't have a problem with it.
email me.
he gets jealous of petty stuff.
I waited til I was married.
Black men like big butts and breasts even if the woman is fat.
love poems are nice but telling straight to her is more manly.
I DONT WANT TO LOOSE OR SCREW UP THE FRIENDSHIP WE HAVE.
if you care for him stay with him.
does he take you out in public?
it sounds strange but most people dont want to sit thru weddings anyways.
if you cannot do this together then you have no business getting married.
if they dont believe in themselves they wont believe in themselves.
move on dude.
first off dude, you should get to know her first.
right, no, but is he really blowing you off?
Asian chicks have small vagina!!!
2) DON'T MAKE ANY DECISIONS UNTIL AFTER YOUR DECISION IS FINALIZED AND THEN ONLY AFTER YOU HAVE CONSIDERED EVERYTHING
you don't want him to think you're interested if you're not.
if you're not happy then why should u stay with him?
its tough but its ok.
we've had ups and downs but we've always pulled thru everything.
we are both really good friends we have dinner, watch movies and hang out on holidays.
confidence is sexy.
flirting is okay!
believe in ur mind then follow ur heart.
thanks brotha.
have you tried kissing her yet?
age is just a number
yeah thats true.

birds are afraid of getting close to people.
even i think bout it sometimes.
don't look for somebody and she will come....
how to tell if she likes you?
yeah dude.
just be who you are dude.
younger guys prefer older women because they think older women are more likely to put out.
give him space dude.
your father will eventually come around trust me.
tell him what happend
get out before it's too late.
she cant find a nice man for herself?
there are black women that prefere white men.
she undecided so you choose no:)  Even if she argues back...just stick to your first responce!  Choose one
