Men play at love to get sex, women play at sex to get love.
I'm sorry if I offended you.
average age difference between guys 16/17 girls 14/15
because women dont understand that most of us cant read minds.
why don´t we just go get some coffee or martini (or both!)
my dad worries too much about me.
go see the doctor dude.
try to make ur questions interesting.
he might be worried about the same thing!
if he really loves u then he wont worry abt sex.
she will never feel how u felt.
with some men you can't make them wait for too long once their ready.
keep trying dude.
girls like manscaping too.
everytime you catch his eye smile
he didn't say he loves you so i wouldn't jump to conclusions.
Denver CO. Hun if you are into chiks who are really hot
men r complicated!!!
i guess thats why i dont judge people too much.
it sounds weird but i do it too.
life is a mix of good and bad.
both of yall gotta be willing to do this.
it frowns on women who just want to get freaky.
why do you like him??????????????
men r afraid of losing em
most guys wont be flattered.
you need counseling.
what else can you call it?
just smile at them
they want us to get confused.
does he show u that he loves u
remember guys love is ok.
don't fall all over him please.
they r all hoes and u r not u r a decent beatiful woman!
there is a possibility that it's real.
most women dont want insecure guys.
that's how people find out if ur single
he asked me if we had any peanuts to eat.
hold her hand and look into her eyes to say it.....trust me it works
don't give yourself up to any man cause most of the time thats all they want.
would you do that guy just cause hes big?
tell him yes.
what did u get urself into?
no matter how our mother looks, but we always love her more then the others.
because they love them.
i have felt telepathy many times.
well it depends on how drunk she was.
if you want to knock yourself out then go ahead.

most of them are losers now.
both say they love me equally.
just to bad they like skinny women.
