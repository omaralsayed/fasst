if you are 25 years old it is ok.
hang out wit friends!!!
call her now n tell her you miss her.
take him to court if he doesnt respond.
some people have them and some dont.
there's no way he'll say no.
even at his age he STILL looks sexy as hell.
just don't do anything drastic!
women hate arrogance.
she might not brush her teeth but she smiles alot
words mean nothing if you dont say them.
men dont know what they want.
I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIM!!
if you decide not to marry you don't have to get married.

almost every guy wants to get in your pants.
