that's how life is.

if its once in awhile occurence then its ok.

just imagine him being a father!

women want both cause it feels good

there are guys waiting for you.

take a vacation or go do something for you.

its happened to me like 3 times before!

you dont have to date anyone you dont want to.

tell him you want him.

I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO!! PLEASE HELP ME!!

girls love guys that are not afraid to show their true feelings.

women think sex is something they do to men.

kissing her like you mean it

i am not this way.

she is out for herself and that is sad!

it depends on how much u like him

keep praying!

if your an adult male age simply shouldnt matter

yeah dude, i know what you mean.

i really think u should leave ur husband a.s.a.p.

if he is gay then he is not interested in you.

where can you get the dish from?

there's lots of stuff you can do.

even told her I would marry her to show her how much I love her.

most young guys i know like dating older women.

if you have even the slightest doubt then don't do it.

she cheated on me with another guy.

relaity depends on personality.

names

stay together for the child but don't marry him.

because bald men are ugly.

wait till your feelings subside.

Ask him if he wants kids. Ask him if hes married. Ask him if hes divorced. Ask him if hes married again. Ask him if hes married again

kick him outta your life.

mail order bride

yeah i talked to him about it.

email me.

he makes a total fool of himself around you.

Black men like big butts and breasts even if the woman is fat.

love poems are nice but telling straight to her is more manly.

you need counseling dude.

if he loves u dont worry bout it.

does he take u out in public?

formal weddings suck.

if you cannot do this together then you should not marry.

if they don't believe in themselves they won't believe in themselves.

first off dude, you should get to know her, become her friend first.

right dude, i know hes blowing me off.

Asian women have small vagina!!!

be careful dude.

I wouldn't marry a woman who wouldn't take my name.

you seem to be going after stupid men.

my boyfriend cheated on me.

if u dont know what to do..then u dont know what ur heart wants.

the one where the hot guy kisses me.

people break up for alot of different reasons.

where are some good places to go?

kissing on the first date is ok.

she likes you as a friend but not as a boyfriend.

love does not go hand in hand with lust.

just say sorry and i made mistake and i didnt mean wat i said and maybe he'll take u back  getting back willmake

I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO!! PLEASE HELP ME!!

if you try hard enough you can find someone perfect.

not all men but SOME DO.

or just keep your maiden name

walk up too her and ask her she is doing.

self pleasure?

there are guys out there who dont like fat girls.

would be nice!  i'm sure there are plenty of couples who do that!  i'm sure they're happy!  i'm sure they're happy

practice kissing on bananas till she can do it without gagging.

IF ITS WORTH IT TO YOU TO DISCUSS HOW YOU ARE FEELING WITH HIM AND IT MAY CHANGE THINGS

okay babe i'll give ya my credit card details.

anywhere

flirt with him

if they dont invite you invite yourself.

hey dude i wanna go out wit u!!!!!!

she forgives but never forgets.

she wants to come to you.

I'm a woman, so I can't tell you much.

i'm thirteen too but i'm thinking the same thing.

don't go solo!

if you love eachother you will find ways to make it work.

eye contact is everything.

either you pick him up or have him pick you up.

trust is gone forever.

well i kissed him on the check in 2nd grade!

why wont you ask her out?

take notes if you have to! then have at it...

phone sex?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

sometimes it is best to wait until you are sure you want to marry him.

if you applyed as much thought to that you would probly make all A's except the girl was in my english class,

don't force yourself to eat it.

yeah dude, you gotta stop thinking about girls.

Best bet.....ask him.....if to shy to ask....have someone else ask for you.

Jaime wants rubi out because she thinks she is too good for him.

but it seems like ur looking for a way out of the relationship.

Secondly - you're not ugly - you're cute.  You're definitely not ugly.  You're definitely cute.  You're definitely cute.  You

who knows? maybe he loves you back.

men r hard to understand but you can get around that.

you guys made us that way.

his answer is good enough for me.

you gotta look inside yourself and see if you really do still love him.

you should feel ashamed of yourself!!!

i think some ppl are born gay or lesbian.

trust me dude, i dont trust him.

yes

tell them you dont want them fighting anymore.

maybe you should be a shoe salesman like Al Bundy

letting him ask you out is fine but dont let him ask you out if you dont want him too.

if there is no love you're not a couple; just 2 people having sex or dating.

they might like you but they dont want you to know things.

who cares what other people think???

PERFECT GIRL IS WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE AND HOW SHE FEELS ABOUT ME.

women want a man who will never cheat on them.

its ok to feel normal!

keep it cool be yourself

look to see where her hands are.

if you dont care if he wanted to be with his friends then its ok.

Men want confident women because they know they can trust them.  Women want confident men because they know they can trust them.  Women want confident men because they
